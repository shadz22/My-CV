## Shadi Khazaei

After working in the Recruitment industry for 7 years, both in Oil & Gas and the healthcare sectors, I knew the time had come for me to move on. I needed a new challenge and I love solving problems, so computer programing really appealed to me, as this was the subject I enjoyed the most whilst studying for my degree in Business Information systems with information technology. I very much enjoy the satisfying feeling of solving a problem/finding a solution.
