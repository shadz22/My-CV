## Shadi Khazaei

Iâ€™m a junior full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and learning new things. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy which is a Software Development Bootcamp. 
The course covers professional web development technologies such as Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Ajax and softer skills, including Object-oriented design, Test Driven Development, Agile Methodology. The program adopts a "learn by doing" approach, achieved largely through self-directed, project-based work. 

I am looking for a Junior level software development role to further develop my skills and get in to the wonderful world of software development.

## Background

After working in the Recruitment industry for 7 years, both in Oil & Gas and the healthcare sectors, I knew the time had come for me to move on. I needed a new challenge and I love solving problems, so computer programing really appealed to me, as this was the subject I enjoyed the most whilst studying for my degree in Business Information systems with information technology. I very much enjoy the satisfying feeling of solving a problem/finding a solution.

## Skills

#### Attention to details

- As part of my previous roles in Compliance both in Oil & Gas and Healthcare International projects coordination, I needed to have an excellent attnetion to details. In Oil and Gas my job envolved signing off international offshore workers from anround the world, such as divers, ROV pilots, Riggers, seamen, etc to be deployed to work in waters around the globe. In the Healthcare sector I was responsible for bringing International nurses and doctors to work in the UK (either in the NHS or the private healthcare sector) Both these roles required a high level of documentations, permits, certifications, vaccinations, visas etc which all meant that I needed to make sure that every document was valid
