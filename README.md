## Shadi Khazaei

After working in the Recruitment industry for 7 years, both in Oil & Gas and the healthcare sectors, I knew the time had come for me to move on. I needed a new challenge and I love solving problems, so computer programming really appealed to me, as this was the subject I enjoyed the most whilst studying for my degree in Business Information systems with information technology. I very much enjoy the satisfying feeling of solving a problem/finding a solution.

I’m a junior full-stack developer with a passion for problem solving and learning new things. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy which is a Software Development Bootcamp. 
The program adopts a "learn by doing" approach, achieved largely through self-directed, project-based work. I am looking for a Junior level software development role to further develop my skills and get in tothe wonderful world of software development.

## Skills

#### Attention to details

As part of my previous roles in both Compliance and International projects coordination, I needed to have an excellent attention to details. In Oil and Gas my job involved signing off international offshore workers from around the world, such as divers, ROV pilots, Riggers, seamen, etc to be deployed to work in waters around the globe. In the Healthcare sector I was responsible for bringing International nurses and doctors to work in the UK (either in the NHS or the private healthcare sector) Both these roles required a high level of documentations, permits, certifications, vaccinations, visas etc to comply with different frameworks and requirements, which meant a high level of attention to details was required.


#### Teamwork

In my last 3 roles I needed to liaise with 3 different departments on a daily basis. This meant that I needed to be a great team player and to be on excellent terms with each team to make sure there are no delays or issues with our candidates work commencements. In order to do this I needed to have empathy, be a good listener and motivator. Also as this was a very complex and long process it was of utmost importance that things were completed within the specified timeframe and sometimes we all had to help each other to make sure this happened. I was always happy to volunteer to help out the team to ensure delivery. I have won awards for being the employee of the month and also employee of the year and I do believe I achieved these because of my teamwork and my relationship with my co-workers, as the winners of these awards were chosen by team votes.
